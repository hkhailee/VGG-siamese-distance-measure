# VGG-siamese-distance-measure
finding average distance of baseline, modified, and control gan, realistic vs sketch


Repository is in partial fulfilment to thesis research and remains under construction.

Current customization underway, move towards vgg-19 over vgg-16 

next testing will be on stylegan2-ada-pytorch image generations from sketches to realistic images without control.

finally will be finished off with control gan implementaiton on stylegan2 sketch to real generated images
